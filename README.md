# Lightweight Contact Form
This is a light, barebones Contact Form plugin for WordPress. No CSS files, no overhead. The goal is fastest page speed. And no spam, so it uses Google reCAPTCHA v3 so as not to annoy your users with any extra step, while keeping your contact form spam-free

**Usage:**

Add the contact form to any page with this shortcode:

`[lcf_contact_form]`

See the [plugin page](https://isabelcastillo.com/lightweight-wordpress-contact-form) for more details.
