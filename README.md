# Absolute Lightest Contact Form
This is a light, barebones Contact Form shortcode for WordPress. No CSS, no settings, no overhead. The goal is fastest page speed.

**Mandatory Step:**

You must edit line 140 of the `contact-form.php` file to change '122' to the page id of your Contact page (the page which will use the shortcode).

See the [plugin page](http://isabelcastillo.com/absolute-lightest-contact-form) for details.
